## Getting started

These examples were created and tested on [Minikube](http://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) running
with Kubernetes v1.7.2.

### Using minikube

```
# start Minikube
minikube start --kubernetes-version v1.7.2

# to speed up the deployment of the app, share Minikube Docker environment
eval $(minikube docker-env)

# build the Docker container used in the example
docker build -t docker build -t ludo/k8s-deployment-demo app
```
