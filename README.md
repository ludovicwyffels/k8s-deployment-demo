Kubernetes deployment strategies
================================

> In Kubernetes there is few different way to release an application, you have
to carefully choose the right strategy to make your infrastructure relisiant.

- [recreate](recreate/README.md): terminate the old version and release the new
  one
- [ramped](recreate/README.md): release a new version on a rolling update
  fashion, one after the other
- [blue/green](recreate/README.md): release a new version alongside the old
  version then switch traffic
- [canary](recreate/README.md): release a new version to a subset of users, then
  proceed to a full rollout
- [a/b testing](recreate/README.md): release a new version to a subset of users
  in a precise way (HTTP headers, cookie, weight, etc.). This doesnâ€™t come out
  of the box with Kubernetes, it imply extra work to setup a smarter
  loadbalancing system (Istio, Linkerd, Traeffik, custom nginx/haproxy, etc).
- [shadow](recreate/README.md): release a new version alongside the old version.
  Incoming traffic is mirrored to the new version and doesn't impact the
  response.

## Getting started

These examples were created and tested on [Minikube](http://github.com/kubernet
es/minikube) running with Kubernetes v1.14.1.

```
$ minikube start --kubernetes-version v1.14.1
```


## Vizualising using Prometheus and Grafana

The following steps describe how to setup Prometheus and Grafana to visualize
the progress and performance of a deployment.

### Install Helm

To install Helm, follow the instructions provided on their [website](https://git
hub.com/kubernetes/helm/releases).

```
$ helm init
```

### Install Prometheus

```
$ helm install \
    --name=prometheus \
    --version=5.0.1 \
    --set=serverFiles."prometheus\.yml".global.scrape_interval=3s \
    stable/prometheus
```

### Install Grafana

```
$ helm install \
   --name=grafana \
   --version=0.5.7 \
   --set=server.adminUser=admin \
   --set=server.adminPassword=admin \
   --set=server.service.type=NodePort \
   stable/grafana
```

### Setup Grafana

Now that Prometheus and Grafana are up and running, you can access Grafana:

```
$ minikube service grafana-grafana
```

To login, username: `admin`, password: `admin`.

Then you need to connect Grafana to Prometheus, to do so, add a DataSource:

```
Name: prometheus
Type: Prometheus
Url: http://prometheus-prometheus-server
Access: Proxy
```

Create a dashboard with a Graph. Use the following query:

```
sum(rate(http_requests_total{app="my-app"}[5m])) by (version)
```

To have a better overview of the version, add `{{version}}` in the legend field.
